"""mesa.experimental.actions: Timed, interruptible actions for Mesa agents.

An Action represents something an agent does over time. It integrates with
Mesa's event scheduling system for precise timing and supports interruption
with progress tracking and optional resumption.

Actions are subclassable: override on_start(), on_complete(),
on_interrupt(), and on_fail() to define behavior. When an action ends,
the agent's Agent.on_idle() hook fires; decisions about what to do
next -- chain another action, resume an interrupted one -- belong there.

Example::

    class Forage(Action):
        def __init__(self, sheep):
            super().__init__(sheep, duration=5.0)

        def on_complete(self):
            self.agent.energy += 30

        def on_interrupt(self, progress):
            self.agent.energy += 30 * progress

    sheep.start_action(Forage(sheep))

    Actions have a duration, can be interrupted, and track their own
    lifecycle state. They integrate with Mesa's event scheduler for
    completion timing.

    Subclass and override on_start/on_complete/on_interrupt for complex
    behavior. All hooks default to doing nothing (pass).

    Attributes:
        agent: The agent performing this action.
        model: The model (shortcut for agent.model).
        name: Human-readable identifier. Defaults to the class name.
        duration: Time to complete. May be a callable(agent) -> float
            for state-dependent duration, resolved at start time.
        priority: Importance level. Higher = more important. May be a
            callable(agent) -> float, resolved once: at start, or earlier
            if Agent.interrupt_for weighs it against a running action.
        interruptible: Whether higher-priority actions can preempt this.
        start_requirements: Predicates that must hold for the action to start.
        completion_requirements: Predicates that must hold for the effect to
            apply. Empty by default.
        state: Current lifecycle state (PENDING, ACTIVE, COMPLETED,
            INTERRUPTED, FAILED).
        progress: Time fraction completed, 0.0 to 1.0. Computed live
            while the action is active.

    Notes:
        Actions hold a reference to their agent, mirroring how agents
        reference their model. This allows actions to query and modify
        agent state directly in their hooks.
