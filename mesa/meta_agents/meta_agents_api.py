        A group is identified by its class name, ``new_agent_class``. When at
        least one of the given agents already belongs to an existing group
        whose class name matches ``new_agent_class``, that group is reused:
        the given agents are added to it and the existing group object is
        returned. Otherwise a new group is created and registered as an agent
        on the model. Note that calling ``create`` with the same class name
        but no overlapping members therefore creates a second, distinct group
        with the same name; name-based lookups (e.g. ``members_of("Team")``)
        then raise because the name is ambiguous. To force a new group, use a
        unique class name (e.g., append a timestamp or UUID). For an example
        see the alliance_formation model.

        Duplicate members are removed, preserving the order of first
        appearance.

        Args:
            new_agent_class: The group's class name. A group with this name is
                reused if any of ``agents`` already belongs to it; otherwise a
                new group with this name is created.
            agents: Initial members of the group.
            mesa_agent_type: Mesa ``Agent`` class used as the base class of the
                group agent. Defaults to ``Agent`` when omitted. Ignored when
                an existing group is reused. Pass a custom ``Agent`` subclass
                to give the group its own behavior.
            meta_attributes: Attributes to set on the group. When a group is
                reused, these are set on the existing group.
            meta_methods: Methods to bind to the group. When a group is
                reused, these are bound to the existing group.
            relation: Membership relation label for ``agents`` (default
                ``"member"``). Ignored when ``memberships`` is given.
            memberships: Alternative to ``agents``; a list of
                ``(member, relation)`` tuples so each member can get its own
                relation label. When given, ``agents`` and ``relation`` are
                ignored.

        Returns:
            The group agent (newly created or existing).

        Examples:
            Create a new team with two members (the group agent defaults to a
            plain ``Agent`` subclass):

            >>> team = model.meta_agents.create("Team", [alice, bob])

            Add carol to the same team. Reuse requires at least one given
            agent to already be in the group, so include an existing member:

            >>> team2 = model.meta_agents.create("Team", [carol, alice])
            >>> assert team is team2

            This is the same as adding carol using ``add_member`` (more
            explicit):

            >>> model.meta_agents.add_member("Team", carol)
            >>> assert carol in model.meta_agents.members_of("Team")

            With the same class name but no overlapping members, a second,
            distinct group is created:

            >>> other_team = model.meta_agents.create("Team", [dave])
            >>> assert other_team is not team

            Force new groups by using unique names:

            >>> team_a = model.meta_agents.create("Team_2026_A", [...])
            >>> team_b = model.meta_agents.create("Team_2026_B", [...])

        The helper discovers potential meta-agents before creating them. It
        deliberately does not mutate model or membership state.

        Args:
            group: The set of agents to find combinations in.
            size: The size or range of sizes for combinations. Defaults to (2, 5).
            evaluation_func: The function to evaluate combinations. Defaults to None.
            filter_func: Allows the user to specify how agents are filtered to form groups.
              Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            List: The list of valuable combinations, in a tuple first agentset of valuable combination  and then the value of
            the combination.
